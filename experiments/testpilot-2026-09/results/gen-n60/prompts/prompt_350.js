Your task is to write a test for the following function
```
zod.z.parse(schema, value, _ctx, _params)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
(schema, value, _ctx, _params) => {
    const ctx = _ctx ? Object.assign(_ctx, { async: false }) : { async: false };
    const result = schema._zod.run({ value, issues: [] }, ctx);
    if (result instanceof Promise) {
        throw new core.$ZodAsyncError();
    }
    if (result.issues.length) {
        const e = new (_params?.Err ?? _Err)(result.issues.map((iss) => util.finalizeIssue(iss, ctx, core.config())));
        util.captureStackTrace(e, _params?.callee);
        throw e;
    }
    return result.value;
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let zod = require('zod');
describe('test zod', function() {
    it('test zod.z.parse', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a single, self-contained unit test.  The test should not rely on any external resources. 
For example, it should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.
Keep the three `require` lines exactly as given and make them the first three lines of your code block; do not put a comment, a file name, or anything else before them. Write exactly one `it` block.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block 
```
<unit test>
```
