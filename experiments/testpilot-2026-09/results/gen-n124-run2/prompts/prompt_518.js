Your task is to write a test for the following function
```
zod.z.superRefine(fn)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function superRefine(fn) {
    const ch = check((payload) => {
        payload.addIssue = (issue) => {
            if (typeof issue === "string") {
                payload.issues.push(index_js_1.util.issue(issue, payload.value, ch._zod.def));
            }
            else {
                // for Zod 3 backwards compatibility
                const _issue = issue;
                if (_issue.fatal)
                    _issue.continue = false;
                _issue.code ?? (_issue.code = "custom");
                _issue.input ?? (_issue.input = payload.value);
                _issue.inst ?? (_issue.inst = ch);
                _issue.continue ?? (_issue.continue = !ch._zod.def.abort);
                payload.issues.push(index_js_1.util.issue(_issue));
            }
        };
        return fn(payload.value, payload);
    });
    return ch;
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let zod = require('zod');
describe('test zod', function() {
    it('test zod.z.superRefine', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a single, self-contained unit test.  The test should not rely on any external resources. 
For example, it should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.
Keep the three `require` lines exactly as given and make them the first three lines of your code block; do not put a comment, a file name, or anything else before them. Write exactly one `it` block.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block 
```
<unit test>
```
